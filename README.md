# GrindPlus - The Ultimate Grinding Tracker Addon

## Overview
GrindPlus is the ultimate tracking addon for World of Warcraft players who want to maximize their efficiency while farming, grinding for gold or resources, or leveling up. Whether you're aiming to boost your in-game wealth, track your XP progression, monitor your loot drops, or now track your **reputation gains**, GrindPlus delivers real-time, detailed insights to enhance your gameplay experience. With its intuitive interface and powerful tracking capabilities, this addon is a must-have for dedicated adventurers.

### **Reputation Tracking**
The new **Reputation Tracking** feature is perfect for players who want to stay on top of their faction reputation grind. It allows you to see how long it will take to reach the next reputation level and how many kills you need to achieve that milestone. This feature is only available for factions that show their reputation as an experience bar, making your reputation tracking more intuitive and rewarding than ever.

## Features
GrindPlus comes packed with essential tracking tools that help you stay on top of your progress:

- **Gold Tracking**: Monitor every piece of gold you earn and spend. Get insights into your total gold and track your gold-per-hour earnings to optimize your farming strategy.
- **XP Tracking**: Keep tabs on your experience gain with detailed stats, including total XP, XP per hour, estimated time to level, and the number of mobs needed to reach the next level. 
- **Mob Kills**: Gain valuable data on all mobs you've slain, with categorized tracking of kill counts by mob name and total kills.
- **Loot Tracking**: Never miss an important drop! GrindPlus records all loot of green rarity and above, including armor, weapons, and recipes. It even calculates drop ratios to help you farm more efficiently.
- **Trade Goods Tracking**: Stay on top of your gathering efforts by tracking trade goods like ores, herbs, cloth, and more. Get estimated drop rates per hour for better resource planning.
- **Reputation Tracking**: Track your progress toward leveling up your reputation with any faction that displays as an experience bar. GrindPlus calculates **Time to Level** your next reputation step and **Kills Needed** to achieve the next reputation milestone, giving you insights to help maximize your faction grind. *(This functionality does not work with negative reputation values and only supports factions that display their reputation as an experience bar.)*
